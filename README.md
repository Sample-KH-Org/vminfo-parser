# vminfo_parser

## Important

`legacy/vm_csv_parser.py` is the original program. However, it was not easy to test of for others to contribute. It is being kept around to ensure like-functionality in the new program `vminfo_parser`. VMInfo is a refactored (into classes) version with tests and a test dataset available for basic output testing.

For more information on the original version, see its [README.md](legacy/README.md)
